 I am a Graduate Research Student at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), where I am pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Software Engineering. My passion for software engineering and innovation stems from my strong academic background in electronics engineering, which I obtained from the prestigious [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) BHU](https://iitbhu.ac.in/) in 2020.

 Before joining University of Waterloo, I contributed significantly to [Samsung's](https://research.samsung.com/sri-n) research and development projects as a Software Engineer for nearly three years. I co-authored three research papers and filed four patents, all aiming to enhance the user experience and push the boundaries of technology. Some of the topics I worked on include optical image stabilization, photography rules, audio equalization, and macrophotography. I also earned multiple certifications in data structures, Python, and deep learning, to further develop my skills and knowledge. My journey is driven by a relentless commitment to innovation and a vision to create a future where technology knows no limits. I am always eager to learn new things, collaborate with others, and take on new challenges. I would love to connect with you and explore how my expertise and passion can add value to your team and your goals. Together, we can shape the future of technology.

          - Developing a novel method to identify distinct and recurring patterns in a given time series. The primary focus of this approach is to ensure high coverage
            of the time series.
          - The solution consists of three stages:
            1. The first stage, Used an established sub-sequences similarity computing method called matrix profile.
            2. The second stage applied constraints on the co-existence of the different candidates and constraints on 
               their selection for the final output.
            3. In the third stage, a constraint solver selected the best-fitting patterns that maximized a gain function 
               while adhering to the given constraints.

           - Developed an autonomous robot using MATLAB for color segmentation, enabling detection of objects based on 
             different colors.
           - Implemented Dijkstra's algorithm for pathfinding, ensuring efficient navigation to deliver objects to 
             desired locations while receiving real-time input from a top-mounted camera for continuous monitoring.

          Project: Image Style Transfer
            - Applied image processing to combine a sequence of photos, extracting the best segments individually to create the
              finest composite image.
            - Developed a model to transfer the style of one image region into another image region associated with
              semantic categories, such as sky, road, and person.
            - Trained our model on MIT ADE20K Dataset which contains more than 20K scene-centric
              images of 150 different object categories.
            - Reduced 150 classes of ADE20K Dataset to 27 classes which were of our interest resulting in
              enhanced segmentation speed.
